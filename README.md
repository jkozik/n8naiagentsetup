# N8N-based AI Agent leveraging ollama on Mac Mini M4

I setup my new Mac Mini M4 and installed [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) on it following the instructions in  [Raid Owl](https://www.youtube.com/@RaidOwl)'s video. That is I installed Ollama native on MacOS so that I can take advantage of [Apple Silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon)

# N8N-based AI Agent leveraging ollama on Mac Mini M4
## Basic Ollama setup to run on Mac Mini M4 (not in docker)
I setup my new Mac Mini M4 and installed [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) on it following the instructions in  [Raid Owl](https://www.youtube.com/@RaidOwl)'s video. That is, I installed Ollama native on MacOS so that I can take advantage of [Apple Silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_silicon). I followed [Raid Owl](https://www.youtube.com/@RaidOwl)'s setup and exposed Ollama through the Open Webui portal.  I found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qGLMlsB8Us) by [BlueSpork](https://www.youtube.com/@BlueSpork) that helps -- it is a relatively straight forward docker container. 

I have a reverse proxy, and I expose this OpenWebUI portal as a subdomain on one of my domain names.  Pretty neat.

## N8N AI Startup Kit
Leveraging my Ollama on Mac Mini M4 setup, I decided to give AI Agent development a try.  On the [N8N github account](https://github.com/n8n-io)), there's the [self-hosted-ai-starter-kit](https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit) is an excellent tutorial that I follow in this section.
